TuneSurfer
=======================

TuneSurfer is the music recognizing application, that can help you quickly and accurately recognize a music track playing nearby you.
This application uses the AudDÂ® service as a Music Recognition API.

I'm developing this application as the project where I learn how to build complex applications using the best coding practices.
At the same time, I try to make the application reliable for everyday use.
